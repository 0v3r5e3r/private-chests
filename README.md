  - Prevents additional signs on locked containers
  - Blocks hopper placement and extraction
  - Protects against TNT explosions
  - Prevents fire spread
  - Blocks piston movement
- **Bedrock Compatible**: Full support for Bedrock players via Floodgate/Geyser

- **Server-Side Only**: No client mod required

## Installation

### Requirements
- Minecraft 1.21.11
- Fabric Loader 0.18.4+
- Fabric API
- Java 21+

### Steps
1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/joelra/private-chests/releases)
2. Place the `.jar` file in your server's `mods` folder
3. Start the server

## Usage

### Creating a Private Chest

1. Place a chest or barrel
2. Attach a wall sign to it
3. On the first line (front or back of the sign), write `[private]` (case-insensitive)
4. Add usernames on the remaining lines to grant access. For Example:
   ```
   [private]
   PlayerName
   AnotherUser,User2
   ```

### Sign Format Rules

- `[private]` must be on line 1 only (exact match, case-insensitive)
- Can be on front OR back of sign
- Usernames on lines 2-4 of front and back
- Supports comma-separated names: `Player1, Player2` or `Player1,Player2`
- Owner automatically has access (don't need to list yourself)

### Managing Access

**Edit existing sign**: Only the owner or admin can edit the private sign

**Remove protection**: Remove `[private]` from both sides of the sign

**Break chest**: Owners can break their locked chest directly (auto-removes lock)

## Admin Commands

All commands require admin permission level 3 (configurable).

### `/private_chests` (alias: `/pchests`)

**List all locks:**
```
/private_chests list
```

**List locks in area:**
```
/private_chests list_in_area [radius]
```
Radius in chunks (default: 1 = 2x2 chunks). Max: 10.

**Get lock info:**
```
/private_chests info <x> <y> <z>
```
Shows owner, allowed users, and timestamps.

**Remove lock:**
```
/private_chests unlock <x> <y> <z>
```

## Configuration

Config file: `config/private-chests.json`

```json
{
  "floodgatePrefix": ".",
  "adminPermissionLevel": 3,
  "listMaxEntries": 50,
  "listPreviewEntries": 20,
  "disableProtectionIfOwnerBanned": true
}
```

### Options

- **floodgatePrefix**: Prefix for Bedrock players (default: `.`)
- **adminPermissionLevel**: Permission level to bypass locks and use commands (0-4, default: 3)
- **listMaxEntries**: Max locks shown in `/list` before abbreviating (default: 50)
- **listPreviewEntries**: Number shown when abbreviated (default: 20)
- **disableProtectionIfOwnerBanned**: Remove protection if owner is banned (default: true)

Invalid values are auto-corrected on startup.

## Bedrock Support

Fully compatible with Floodgate/Geyser for Bedrock players:
- Bedrock players can create and use private chests
- Configure `floodgatePrefix` to match your Floodgate settings
- Default prefix is `.` (e.g., `.BedrockPlayer`)

## Technical Details

- **Server-side only**: No client mod needed
- **Data persistence**: Locks saved to `world/data/private-chests.dat`
- **Performance**: Packet-level interception and caching

## Known Issues

Due to Minecraft's client-side prediction system, some visual glitches may occur when unauthorized actions are blocked:

### Sign Text Disappearing
When a player attempts to break someone else's private sign:
- The sign remains intact (protected on server)
- The sign text may disappear on the client
- **Fix**: Left-click or right-click the sign to restore the text display
- Sign data is always preserved on the server; this is purely visual

### Item "Disappearing" When Placing Blocks
When attempting to place blocks on/near locked containers:
- The block placement is denied by the server
- The item may temporarily disappear from the hotbar
- **Fix**: Interact with that hotbar slot (switch to it, or move the item)
- The item is never lost; it's still in your inventory

These are Minecraft client limitations and do not affect functionality or data integrity. I'm sure there's ways to solve this, but it requires further investigations.
